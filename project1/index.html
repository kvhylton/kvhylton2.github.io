    <p><b><i>Thailand</i></b> is the travel hub of Southeast Asia. Most visitors coming into the region fly into Bangkok and make that their base for doing the circuit as they backpack around Southeast Asia.</p>
    <h3>Places to go in Thailand</h3>
    <a href="chiangmai.html"><img src="images/photos/chiangmai.jpg" alt="Image of Chiang Mai" title="Chiang Mai, Thailand" width="400" height="250" border="2"></a> <figcaption><i>Chiang Mai, Thailand </i></figcaption>
    <p>Chiang Mai is the largest and most culturally significant city in northern Thailand and the main base of activities for most travelers who come up north.
      This is one of the most visited cities in Thailand for travelers of all types!
      Whether you want to backpack Chaing Mai, visit on a budget, or enjoy the luxury hotels here, you will find Chiang Mai full of culture, friendly locals, incredible food markets, dozens of beautiful temples, a relaxed vibe, beautiful landscapes. It’s even become something of the new “it” spot for expats and digital nomads in the last few years.</p>

    <p>Bangkok is the capital and most populous city of Thailand. It is known in Thai as Krung Thep Maha Nakhon or simply Krung Thep. While you’re here, don’t miss the city’s serene temples, including Wat Pho and Wat Arun, which are two of the city’s holiest sites. By contrast, Lumphini Park, the city’s answer to New York’s Central Park, is filled with a large lake brimming with monitor lizards. And, even conservative eaters shouldn’t hold back from enjoying the city’s 24-hour street-side food stalls, which really are unique to Bangkok. And if haggling at the markets, puzzling out what you’re eating at the stalls, or the chaos in general leave you weary, don’t fret: the city’s plush hotel offerings and world-renowned spas will give you just the quiet getaway you’ll need to refresh.</p>
