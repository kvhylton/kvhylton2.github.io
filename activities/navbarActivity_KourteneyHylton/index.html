    <h2 id="wat">Wat Arun</h2>
    <p>Wat Arun, locally known as Wat Chaeng, is a landmark temple on the west (Thonburi) bank of the Chao Phraya river. It’s easily one of the most stunning temples in Bangkok, not only because of its riverside location but also because the design is very different from the other temples you can visit in Bangkok. Wat Arun (nicknamed the Temple of the Dawn) is partly made up of colourfully decorated spires and stands majestically over the water.

      Wat Arun is almost directly opposite Wat Pho, so it’s very easy to get to. From Saphan Taksin boat pier you can take a riverboat that stops at Pier 8. From here, a small shuttle boat takes you from one side of the river to the other. <br><br>
      We would recommend spending at least an hour visiting the temple. Although it’s known as the Temple of the Dawn, it's absolutely stunning at sunset, particularly when lit up at night. Even so, the quietest time to visit is early morning, before the crowds.

      Given the beauty of the architecture and the fine craftsmanship, it’s not surprising that Wat Arun is considered by many as one of the most beautiful temples in Thailand. The prang (spire) by the Chao Phraya is one of Bangkok's world-famous landmarks. The imposing spire rises over 70 metres high, beautifully decorated with tiny pieces of coloured glass and Chinese porcelain placed delicately into intricate patterns. <br><br>
      You can climb the central prang if you wish – the steps are very steep but there’s a railing to help with your balance. Getting up is as tricky as getting down! When you reach the highest point you can see the winding Chao Phraya River and the Grand Palace and Wat Pho opposite. Along the base of this central tower are sculptures of Chinese soldiers and animals.

      Head into the ordination hall and you can admire a golden Buddha image and the detailed murals that decorate the walls. Although Wat Arun is very popular for tourists, it’s also an important place of worship for Buddhists. Make sure you dress appropriately or pick up one of the cover-ups that are available for rent near the entrance. <br><br>
      Wat Arun was envisioned by King Taksin in 1768. It’s believed that after fighting his way out of Ayutthaya, which was taken over by a Burmese army at the time, he arrived at this temple just as dawn was breaking. He later had the temple renovated and renamed it Wat Chaeng, the Temple of the Dawn. It used to be the home of the Emerald Buddha before the capital and Palace was moved to the other side of the river. This can now be seen at the Grand Palace.

      The central prang was extended during the reign of Rama III (between 1824 and 1851) and is now one of the most visited sites in Thailand. It was also Rama III who added the decoration of the spires with porcelain so that they glimmer in the sunshine.</p>

    <h2 id="chao">Chao Phraya River</h2>
    <p>Like all urban rivers, the history of the Chao Phraya is intertwined with the city it flows through. The original site was chosen by early settlers because of its fertility and abundant fish. Later, King Taksin, after the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese, located his new capital here on the western banks that's today known as Thonburi.

      In 1782 King Rama I, finding the eastern banks more favourable, founded modern Bangkok and celebrated the occasion by building some of the world's most beguiling temples. The canals it feeds later became famous, earning Bangkok its 'Venice of the East' nickname. Meanwhile, eminent western authors like Maugham, Conrad and Coward singled out the Chao Phraya as one of their favourite spots in the Far East. <br><br>
      Truly, the River of Kings – as King Rama I named it – is the lifeblood of Bangkok. And that’s not just because of this rich history. Around 50,000 people still use the ferries here to get around each day. Slow barges bearing cargo coast upstream. Kids still frolic in the russet-brown water. Wooden shacks, mottled by the elements, still lurch over the riverbanks.

      Soaring hotels and condominiums hem in solemn temples, churches and civic buildings that look 19th-century European. Not far away, the odd wooden sampan sells noodle soup or dried squid to hungry river workers. It is this juxtaposition of calm and chaotic, modern and traditional, religious and secular, ugly and sublime, foreign and indigenous, which makes the Chao Phraya so evocative. <br><br>
      There are 5 public boat lines, all operated by the Chao Phraya Express Boat company, that ply the same 21-km route: 'local line', 'orange', 'yellow', 'blue' and 'green-yellow'. Operating between 6am and 7.30pm daily, each is identifiable by the coloured flag hanging off its rear.

      The rush-hour only 'local line' stops at all 34 piers, while the other four are express lines stopping at only selected piers. Only the Orange Flag Line, with its flat fee of 15 baht, runs all day and on weekends – for most journeys, this fits the bill. The others stop at around 9am and begin again at around 4pm. Cross-river ferries operate at most major piers and will drop you to the other bank for a very budget-friendly fare.<br><br>
      The Chao Phraya 'Tourist Boats' are another option, offering unlimited trips to 9 prominent piers for a flat fee (service hours are between 9.30am and 3pm daily). That's not a bad deal if you plan to do a lot of hopping on and off over one day, want more comfort and the sites to be pointed out to you.

      Bear in mind though – these run every 30 minutes while the public lines used by locals typically run every 15 to 20 minutes. Other options for exploring the river include hiring a long-tail boat (usually includes trips down the city's canals), a river cruise or dinner cruise. All give a different perspective on this fascinating river. </p>



    <h2 id="zoo">Safari World Zoo and Park</h2>
    <p>Safari World near Bangkok is a zoo for those who don't like zoos… Of course, like any animal park, it has some good and some not so good sides, but the animals here certainly do have a huge amount of space where they can roam free.

      Opened since 1988, Safari World is divided into 2 distinct areas. The open space of Safari Park is where you can drive through in your car or in the park bus. The open zoo is about 480 acres and the bird park 180 acres. Marine Park is more of a traditional zoo mixed with many shows, lots of food stalls and plenty of souvenir shops. <br><br>
      The open-air Safari Park is where you can enjoy an impressive 8-km journey through where animals wander free and where humans in vehicles are just tolerated. The first part is home to many species of herbivores: zebras, camels, antelopes, gazelles, rhinos and an amazing amount of large birds: ostriches, pelicans, cranes, and nightmarish marabou storks.

      As you drive through, you can stop your car as you please to admire this large display of animals, but you'll need to respect few simple rules: drive slowly, don't feed the animals, and don't honk or make loud noises. You can even open your windows as long as you don't step out of the vehicle.

      Further, an astonishing amount of giraffes gracefully walk around the feeding area, supposedly the largest herd in the world. It's a really different experience to drive in the middle of free and healthy animals which are obviously not paying much attention to human visitors. The wilderness of Safari World is not something you could expect so close to a big frantic city.<br><br>
      The mood changes a bit as you reach a couple of massive metal gates and above them is a security lookout tower that easily reminds you of the Jurassic Park entrance.

      Before opening the first gate a security guard voice firmly invites visitors to get back inside their cars and close all windows, then only the first gate slowly rolls sideways and vehicles can move into a safety area. Once the back gate is safely closed behind you, the one in front starts to open and you may enter the predators' den.

      Even though you know animals are well fed and appear to be napping in the tree shade, rolling in the grass or even bathing (tigers seem to love bathing), you cannot remain indifferent to the size of the many tigers, lions and massive Himalayan black bears.<br><br>
      As Safari World wants to be more than just an animal park, you can also watch a western cowboy stunt show or the even more incongruous Spy War, a Hollywood-like performance with explosions so loud they can be heard across the entire zoo. Some less-visited part of the zoo shelter amazingly large fish, some of which can be more than 2 metres long.

      Even so, don't miss the best attraction of the zoo: the giraffe feeding platform where you can feed bananas to these friendly giants – and possibly being liked by their very long and slimy black tongues. Definitely an unusual photo to take back home.

      Despite some of the animal-‘not-so’-friendly entertainments, Safari World is a big favourite of families and kids, Thais and tourists, and a great way to spend the day away from the city as well as share with the kids the rare pleasure of getting really close to animals that you’d often see in the wild. </p>
